# Drafto: The Draft App I Want

## Motivation

There are a lot of great draft simulators out there: DraftSim, DraftPod, CubeCobra's Playtest mode, and more.
I love them, and they are and will probably always be better than this at what they do.

I'm making this because none of them do all of what I want a draft simulator to do.
Check out the feature wishlist below for what I want.

## Feature Wishlist

- Draft with friends
- Web App
- Discord integration (auth & notifications)
- Mobile App (with notifications)
- Support Live or Async drafts
- Time limits on picks, with pauses (e.g. six hours to pick, paused 9pm-9am)
- Support official magic sets and cubes (ideal: CubeCobra support)
- Stretch Goal: Support oddball draft formats (Solomon, Grid, etc)

## Milestones

For now, this is the plan. Obviously, I'd like there to be more, but this will do for now.

- [x] Dumb API - don't deal with any bad/malicious input (in progress)
- [x] Dumb webapp - barely functional
- [ ] Tighten up API - handle bad input, log errors, etc
- [ ] Add some dumb bots
- [x] Auth with discord
- [ ] Less dumb webapp
- [x] CubeCobra support
- [ ] Dumb mobile app
- [ ] Mobile notifications
